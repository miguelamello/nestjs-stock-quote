## PRUVO CURRENCY CONVERSION MICROSERVICE
Currency Conversion Microservice for Pruvo Code Assignment. This microservice allows an easily conversion between country currencies. 

### Infrastructure
I've decided to use Nest.js for this project. I believe Nest.js is the most powerfull 
and well thought Node Framework for building modern web applications and microservices. 
Nest.js supports Typescript by default which together another modules of Node turns the 
final result application bullet proof. 

Backend Stack:

* Node.js LTS (18.14.2)
